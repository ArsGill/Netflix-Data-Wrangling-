# Netflix Data Wrangling Project

###  Overview
This project focuses on **data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Netflix dataset.  
The goal was to prepare the data for deeper insights and future modeling tasks using Python data science libraries.

---

###  Objectives
- Load and inspect raw Netflix data  
- Handle **missing values** and inconsistent data types  
- Extract and engineer new features (e.g., release year, duration type)  
- Perform **data wrangling** to create a structured and clean dataset  
- Visualize insights using **Matplotlib**

---

### Skills & Tools Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy** – numerical computations  
- **Pandas** – data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** – data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

### Dataset
Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset (publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows))  
Contains details about movies and TV shows such as:
- Title  
- Director  
- Cast  
- Country  
- Release year  
- Rating  
- Duration  
- Genre

---

###  Results
- Cleaned dataset ready for analysis and visualization  
- Visualized the distribution of shows across genres, countries, and release years  
- Extracted useful insights for possible recommendation or prediction models

---

### 💡 Future Work
- Apply **Machine Learning models** for genre or rating prediction  
- Integrate **scikit-learn pipelines** for automated preprocessing
